I'm a software engineer based in Bristol, UK. 

I bring a structured approach to the design and development of software applications. I'm an advocate of domain-driven design, test-driven development, immutable data modeling, and iterative and incremental methodologies complemented by continuous delivery processes. 

I specialise in the development of RESTful microservices, written in PHP and served from LAMP-like stacks. I also write JavaScript, primarily for web browsers, and I dabble in Go.
